# Exellence: 
Use complex programming techniques to develop a refined computer program.

The student has:
ensured that the program is a well-structured, logical response to the task 
For example (partial evidence):
Program code is easy to read/understand and has been set up in a logical fashion.  Functions and classes have been used to keep distinct tasks separate, and to avoid duplicate code.  The program explicitly passes data between classes and functions and avoids the use of global variables. Where the program uses a GUI, the GUI and the underlying code are kept separate, and communicate via a well-defined interface.

made the program flexible and robust
comprehensively tested and debugged the program
For example (partial evidence):
Student provides evidence of comprehensively testing their program to show that it works correctly for expected, unexpected and boundary values.  It has been structured so that making changes to it is easy.  For example, the code uses named constants, clearly defined in a ‘constants’ area. The code uses derived values, such as the length of a list, in place of literals.
